## Bit more about myself

I am a second year MHA student at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health with a focus on Health Policy and Management. My working experiences range from consulting, hospital, to government agencies. I grasped strong project management and leadership skills.
I practiced how to analyze market opportunities from my consulting experience. I learned how to improve hospital efficiency from my hospital administration internship. I adopted new approaches to educate providers and improve population health at the New York State Department of Health. These experiences enable me to think from the perspectives of different stakeholders and make good strategic decisions. When I’m not work, I like reading celebrities’ biographies, traveling to beautiful beaches, and making Asian food .
